<h2 mat-dialog-title>Retrieve data from Spotify</h2>

<div mat-dialog-content>
  Spotify keeps track of all your plays over the past year. Unfortunately it doesn't provide a decent way to<br>retrieve this data programmatically so you'll have to request this data manually.

  <ol>
    <li>Login to spotify and go to the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/" target="_blank">privacy page</a>.</li>
    <li>Scroll to the very bottom and click on "Request".</li>
    <li>Prove you're not a robot and confirm the data request in your mail.</li>
    <li>Wait. This takes a maximum of 30 days, but mostly you'll receive an e-mail within a week.</li>
    <li>Download the zip and upload my_spotify_data.zip here.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div mat-dialog-actions>
